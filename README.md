# Basics-of-Python-6---Type-of-Functions

# Type of Function

1.Built-in Functions : These are functions that are built into the Python language. Examples include print(), len(), input(), range(), etc.

2.User-defined Functions : These are functions defined by the user to perform a specific task. They are defined using the def keyword.

3.Anonymous Functions (Lambda Functions) : These are small, anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword. They can have any number of arguments but can only have one expression.

4.Recursive Functions : These are functions that call themselves directly or indirectly in order to solve a problem. Recursion is a common technique used in algorithms and mathematical problems.

5.Higher-order Functions : These are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as output. Examples include map(), filter(), reduce(), etc.

6.Generator Functions : A Generator in Python returns an iterator that produces a sequesnce of value one at a time. They are defined using 'yield' statement insted of 'return'. It is perticularly usefull for handleling large amount of data or when you want to iterate over a sequence withput storing a entire sequence in the memory.

7.Decorator Functions : In python, Decorators are special function that are extra functionality to another function. they do this without changing the other function code directly.
